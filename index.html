              <h1><b>Why adoption over buying </b></h1>
              <p>Did you know that over 1,000 people per hour run a search right here looking to adopt a pet? Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog or cat, and rightly so, there are many benefits to adopting a pet. Pet adoption fees are usually much lower than buying from a breeder. You’re also likely to find a pet who’s already learned a few things. Adoptable pets are often already housetrained, good with kids, and do well with other pets. And don’t forget the wonderful feeling you get from saving a life!</p>
